No known problems

I tested my code for correctness by working on one part of the assignment one at a time
and then testing the method or part of the code to see if I got the expected result. If I
did not get those results I would try to break down the method or that part of the assignment
even further to figure out the problem. I used exceptions for error handling by throwing obvious
cases (i.e index out of bounds, removing an item that doesn't exist, removing an item when
the collection is empty) and if there were other cases that popped up in the development process
then I would incorporate them.

Generic Programming is where you generalize code so that it can be used in multiple scenarios.
One of the ways of doing this is by creating templates. Templates offer generic programming in this 
scenario because the Collection structure can hold both Stress_ball and Jeans objects (with their 
color and size enum classes respectively). At first, the Collection structure could only hold and 
manipulate Stress_ball objects. But by using templates, the Collection structure is manipulated to 
hold any object and two enum classes that go along with that object. This results in now being able
to use the Collection structure for not only the Stress_ball object, but also the Jeans object and
any object the user decides to create.
